Craft beer best recommendations.

Hi everyone!

My name is Michael Koenig. I am currently working on a web application similiar to Untapped or Beer Advocate. This is still in the very early stages of development. I am just finishing up the design part. I will be working on the functionality and setting up a server and database soon. This site will host all of my top recommendations for craft beers and will have a lot of educational information about the different types of beers, hops and the brewing process. Since I am still fairly new to the development world I welcome you all to take a look at my project files and would appreciate any help and recommendations on improving this application you can give me. My hope with this application, when it is all finished, is to better inform those who are curious about trying new beers and introducing them to some great tasting beers which will hopefully change their perspective on craft beers.
